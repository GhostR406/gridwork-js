I LOVE coding, it would not be an overstatement to say it's my one and only hobby. I love creating cool things like games, but frankly the one thing keeping me from really enjoying it is annoying vfx and sprites. I hate making art, models, animations, particles, etc. That's why I have made this, a simple framework so I can make webgames without all the hassles of art. The main idea behind this is the game is just a buncha symbols in a grid, like you see in old command prompt games like NetHack.
